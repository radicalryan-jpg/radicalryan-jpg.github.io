  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  
  <p>To get started, select the user name above that you were given by your teacher.</p>
  <p>Then, click the slider on the left labeled "Templates and Files" to see a list of templates you can use. Click one of the templates to modify it. (If you are new here, try the Basic HTML Template.)</p>
  <p>To save a copy, click Save. You can keep working on that file as well as the CSS and Javascript files in the tabs next to index.html and save versions.</p>
  <p>When you are ready to publish something to the web, you can select the tab for the file and click Copy Code to add it to your clipboard. Then paste it wherever you put your web pages -- such as Github Pages.</p>
